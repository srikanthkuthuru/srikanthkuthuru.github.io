			<h1>Hi there, I'm Srikanth!</h1>
			<p>I am a graduate student at Rice University working in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I am 
			from Vizag, a beautiful city on the eastern coast of South India. I love travelling, music, squash and meeting new people.
			I completed Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras and then proceeded 
			to pursue Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University. 
			I am an application oriented person and my present interests mainly lie in the healthcare domain. 
			AI/Machine Learning techniques can be applied in many areas to gain insights and improve efficiencies.
			One such area specific to healthcare is drug discovery. 
			Computational drug discovery has been around since a decade. 
			But, with recent advances in high throughput screening, Machine learning techniques and massive hardware improvements 
			we can now perform drug discovery with more precision and efficiency.
