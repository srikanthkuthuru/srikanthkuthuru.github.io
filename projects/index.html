<h3>Radiomics</h3>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Radiomics/Radiogenomics is a rapidly growing field in which complex imaging features are 
extracted from radiology images to predict clinical outcomes, genetic alterations and other outcomes relevant 
to a patient's prognosis. This is a non-invasive approach which provides molecular information unlike a
 traditional biopsy procedure. Most models in radiomics derive numerous texture 
features from an imaging dataset and then learn complicated, nonlinear hypotheses to solve a given 
prediction task. However, such approaches present the challenging task of deriving interpretable insights 
into the data. Visual interpretability is essential for effective adoption of 
radiomic models into the clinical decision-making process. We have used a technique called dictionary learning 
to derive visually interpretable radiomic features relevant to genetic alterations in low-grade 
 gliomas.
